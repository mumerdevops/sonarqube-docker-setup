Before starting, you **must** run the following commands on your Linux host (Ubuntu/WSL2) to prevent the embedded Elasticsearch from crashing. These settings increase the memory map limits.

```bash
# Increase memory limits (Mandatory)
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=524288
sudo sysctl -w fs.file-max=131072

# To make these changes permanent across reboots:
echo "vm.max_map_count=524288" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
echo "fs.file-max=131072" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
